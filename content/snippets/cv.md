I am an experienced B2B SaaS CPTO with a passion for breaking down silos. As a startup founder, interim manager, and advisor, I bridge the gap between technical scalability and agile product strategy and support leadership teams in achieving this integration themselves.

I founded and led the startups [Buddybrand](https://www.buddybrand.com/) (digital agency) and [BuzzBird](https://www.buzzbird.de/) (B2B marketplace) and built corporate startups and business units for Voith [Voith](https://voith.com) (IoT / B2B SaaS) and [edding](https://www.edding.com/de-de/) (B2B SaaS).

Based in Berlin, I have extensive experience and prefer to work with diverse teams â€“ mostly but not limited to remote environments. I am also a [speaker]({{< relref path="/pages/speaking" >}}), [blogger]({{< relref path="/posts" >}}), and [book author]({{< relref path="2015-practical-guide-facebook-development">}}).

Move Fast And Break Silos!
