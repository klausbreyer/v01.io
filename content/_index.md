summary: As a startup founder and experienced CPTO, I break silos by empowering organizations to seamlessly integrate product and technology while enabling leadership teams to cultivate a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration. As an interim manager or advisor, I help companies bridge the gap between technical excellence, agile product development, and impactful leadership.
