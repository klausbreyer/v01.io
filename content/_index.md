I'm Klaus Breyer. With [a lifetime in tech]({{< relref "/pages/cv" >}}), a degree in Software Engineering, and a passion for innovation, I went from founding my first startup in 2010 to playing key roles as _CTO/CTPO_ in many others.

As I bootstrap my next startup idea, I'm _available for consulting and interim leadership gigs_, leveraging my extensive experience.

## Proven Impact and Expertise

I turn visionary business goals into concrete results, with focused expertise at the _intersection of product and tech organization_.
It's not merely about coding; it's about crafting standout products that make a mark and drive business forward.

1. _Startup strategy_ – turning ideas into impactful ventures.
1. Selling the _tech vision_ – whether it's to investors or stakeholders.
1. _Prototyping & Crafting_ the first version of a product from scratch, if need be.
1. Assembling and Nurturing _a Killer Team_ – Remote or in Berlin.
1. Bringing _product & engineering processes_ up to speed - fostering _asynchronous collaboration_.

## Shape Up

I'm all in on [Shape Up]({{< relref "/tags/shapeup/" >}}) - Agile's got a new face, and it's thrilling: _Fixed time, variable scope_. The only way to deliver quality - on time.

It is all about the people: Developers, designers, product managers – all on the same page, sculpting ideas into reality.

Want to spar about it? I offer free 1-hour sessions. Need a deep dive? I'm here for hands-on guidance.

## Modern Web Stacks & Leadership

From startup _monoliths_ to large _microservice_ environments, I've led and launched.

But beyond the tech, I build infrastructures that empower.

_Teams that innovate._

_Projects that matter._

## Writer & Speaker

I've penned down my thoughts in [articles]({{< ref "/posts/">}}) and shared them out loud at [conferences]({{< relref "appearances">}}). Whether it's a page or a stage, I'm there.

## My v0.1 Manifest

> Good software is always used but never finished.

That's it.

## Connect with Me

Tech, product, business – that's where I thrive.

More than code, it's about _weaving the tech fabric into the company's culture_.

For agencies, SME or fledgling startups.
