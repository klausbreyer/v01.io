# Hi, I am Klaus Breyer

.. and I have been responsible for technology and teams since I founded my first startup in 2010, right after graduating in **Software Engineering**. Since then, I have been actively or consultatively involved in several other companies as CTO and CPO. I have built, managed, and launched many individual technical projects in (a constantly changing) **modern web stack**: From fast-moving independent startup projects to brownfield microservice environments.

For my teams, I emphasize working on a **stable technical and organizational infrastructure** so that every team member can work focused on problems worth tackling, providing user value.

I develop tech strategies for companies based on cutting-edge knowledge of the technology landscape and finding/nurturing internal innovations.

[If you have an interesting problem, consider hiring me.]({{< ref "/consulting" >}})

I am a big believer in **Shape Up**, an up-and-coming Method for agile software development. I offer free 1h sparring sessions around this topic or paid hands-on help to implement the method in organizations of various sizes.

[If you are interested in Shape Up, you should visit my dedicated page.]({{< ref "shape-up" >}})

On the side, I also develop and market some [projects]({{< ref "/categories/unixtime.app" >}}) of my own, publish [open source]({{< ref "/categories/open-source" >}}), and invest time or money in startups through a [small fund]({{< ref "/pages/funding" >}}).

Besides [my own book,]({{< ref "/posts/praxishandbuch-facebook-entwicklung" >}}) I also wrote many guest articles for other blogs, and I am used to standing on a conference stage, giving [talks]({{< ref "/pages/talks" >}}) in front of a developer crowd.

Articles from others that I have read/highlighted via pocket [are published online.](https://pocket.v01.io/)
