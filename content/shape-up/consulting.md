While my workshops provide hands-on education for teams, implementing a holistic process within an organization requires a more personalized approach. I offer individual consultation sessions tailored to the unique needs of your company, ensuring that the principles learned in the workshops are seamlessly integrated into your business operations.

## My Consultation Focus Areas

- **Stage Gates & Betting Tables:** Establishing effective decision-making processes for project progression.
- **Product Release Cycles:** Streamlining product launches and updates for maximum impact.
- **Strategic Alignment:** Connecting the dots between Shape Up principles and high-level strategy tools like OKRs.
- **Inter-departmental Harmony:** Ensuring smooth collaboration and clear communication between departments.
- **Team Composition:** Guidance on forming teams for optimal efficiency and collaboration.
- **Requirement Essentials:** Setting up foundational elements like enablement teams, on-call rotations, and more, to facilitate work in a fixed time, variable scope environment.
