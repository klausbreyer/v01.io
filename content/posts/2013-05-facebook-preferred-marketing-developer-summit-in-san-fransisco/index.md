I will also use this blog to write about private matters in the context of the mobile lifestyle. Mobile also means being on the go. And I was! Namely in San Francisco!

A dream came true. I made a pilgrimage to Mecca: Facebook invited me to the Preferred Marketing Developer Summit for the third time. I had already been to London twice for this, but this time I managed to make it to headquarters in San Francisco. You can also make it sound a bit better: The flight was more expensive, but the hotel was cheaper. Additionally, there were scheduling conflicts with the London date. At such a summit, the [Preferred Marketing Developers](http://www.facebook-pmdcenter.com/), a circle of approximately 300 agencies worldwide, are invited to receive the pure essence from various Facebook executives.

I prefer to travel with only hand luggage. So for weight reasons, I only had my 11" MacBook Air with me. I was glad to still have it, as I had been planning to sell it for a while, since after almost 3 years it no longer quite met my requirements. It wasn't a mistake to bring it this time either â€“ but next time I'll probably limit myself exclusively to the [newly acquired iPad](http://mobizzle.de/2013/04/07/der-shit-o-call-beim-hack-der-deutschen-telekom/) when traveling. Roughly in the same league in terms of dimensions and weight. And except for programming, you can do everything on the iPad these days:

- Gmail
- Evernote
- Spotify
- Google Drive

Even Keynote is available for iPad now. However, for presentations, you need an Apple TV or an expensive cable. What still doesn't work at all is programming. At the Music Hack Day in Stockholm, the 11" was too small for that anyway. For such purposes, I'll probably take a proper 15" device with more performance in the future.

A word about my new [BOSE Quiet Comfort 15 headphones](http://www.bose.de/DE/de/home-and-personal-audio/headphones-and-headsets/acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones/quietcomfort-15-headphones/). These served excellently. They have active noise cancellation. This means that ambient noise is analyzed and compensated for using microphones, while still being blasted with full BOSE sound. Neither screaming children nor drunk Americans could get through. With speech, such as podcasts, you could still faintly hear the hum of the engines. Otherwise, heavenly peace.

I unfortunately only had half a day to take some Instagram photos in the city, but the city is simply brilliant. Mild, warm, coastal weather with just enough wind that heatstroke can be easily ignored. And America, ah! It was my first time in America and it's exactly as you imagine: The startups are more techy, the streets are wider, the cars are bigger, the street names are more logical, the weather is better, the drinks are sweeter and the food is fattier.

You can tell that in the New World, the mistakes of the Old World should be eliminated. God bless America.
