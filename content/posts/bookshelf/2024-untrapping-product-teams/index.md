David Pereira's _Untrapping Product Teams_ provides actionable insights into moving beyond feature factories to truly empowered product teams. It challenges conventional ways of working and encourages focusing on value creation through collaboration, experimentation, and simplification.

**Top 3 Learnings:**

1. **Kill the feature factory mindset.** Instead of focusing on outputs and backlogs, prioritize learning and outcomes by continuously evaluating ideas and eliminating those that donâ€™t serve the product vision.

2. **Empowerment over micromanagement.** Product teams should take ownership of their decisions, work collaboratively with stakeholders, and embrace experimentation rather than being dictated by top-down roadmaps and deadlines.

3. **Value-driven prioritization.** Adopt a structured approach to evaluating opportunities based on desirability, feasibility, viability, and ethics to ensure the right problems are being solved.
