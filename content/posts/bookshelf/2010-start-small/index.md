The book provides a practical guide to launching and growing a self-funded startup by focusing on small, niche markets. Walling emphasizes the importance of starting with a manageable scope, validating ideas through existing demand signals, and leveraging lean principles to build sustainable businesses without relying on outside funding.

**Top 3 Learnings:**

1. A good niche already has an existing market—indicators such as books, podcasts, and conferences prove demand and reduce risk when entering the space.
2. Niche selection should prioritize focus over size—smaller, unattractive niches with unmet needs are easier to dominate and less likely to attract competition.
3. Bootstrapping success relies on discipline and gradual growth—by staying lean and focusing on recurring revenue, entrepreneurs can maintain control and long-term sustainability.
