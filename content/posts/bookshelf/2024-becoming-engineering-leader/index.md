## Time: Observed, Spent & Allocated

- Own strategic work

## Organizing Work

#### 66: Capacity Management > Time Management. It fluctuates with context.

#### 78: Calendar:

- Group similar-context meetings together
- Block time for deep work in the morning/evening
- Office hours

#### 81: Focus Blocks:

- With a goal! E.g., daily/weekly objectives
- Reading / Reviewing
- Async content to broadcast
- Other long-term activities

Not for:

- Normal messengers/emails

Unplanned:

- Using own product
- Reviewing other teams' work
- Reading design docs
- Field research

## Async Work

#### 84: When to hold a meeting:

- High-bandwidth communication
- Building trust & support
- Everyone must be present simultaneously

#### 85: Meeting Agenda:

- Lead by example, don’t force others

#### 87: Regularly delete all recurring meetings to reset the org

#### 88: Alternatives to Meetings:

- **Standups → Async updates**
- **Group Sync → Async updates**
- **1:1s → Not status updates but coaching**
- **Staff Meeting → Focus topics**
- **Brainstorming → Pre-prepared async contributions**

## The Games We Play and How to Win Them

#### Coaching vs. Directing:

- **Goal** (of the session)
- **Reality** - Current situation
- **Options** - How to tackle it
- **Wrap-Up** - Next steps/decisions

#### 96: Delegation

- 1:1s, weekly, 30 min
- Shared agenda
- No status updates
- Link topics to Employee Development

#### 109: Finite vs. Infinite Games

- **Finite Games**: Platforms over a swamp of infinite games/chaos
- **Infinite Games**: Goal: Keep playing!
- **Finite Games**: Goal: Winning (e.g., task completion, sprint, etc.)
- **Concept for Workshops**: Explain how limiting Work in Progress (WIP) enhances strategy execution

## Communication at Scale

#### 195: Treat the org as an evolving organism

#### 198: Best async communication practice for leaders covering large org areas: **techemails.com**

#### 201: Optimizing for decision speed: One-way vs. two-way doors

#### 205: Leadership = Writing

- Writing to think
- Interrogate thoughts
- Edit to read

## Performance Management

#### 229: Performance Management of Senior Staff = Measuring the output of their leadership

#### 231: Assessment Criteria:

- **Self-Assessment** (Subjective, Qualitative, Quantitative)
- **KPI** (Defined, Progressed, Achieved/Exceeded)
- **360° Feedback** (Quantitative)
- **Leader Assessment** (Qualitative)

#### 245: "Your lowest performer is the performance bar you accept."

## Strategy 101

#### 259: Engineering Strategy:

- Trade-offs: Quality vs. Speed
- Key KPIs to hit
- Tackling Tech Debt
- Build vs. Buy decisions
- Conflicting Priorities

## Company Cycles

#### 279: Shift focus from dates to reducing uncertainty

#### 280: Uncertainty: Y-Axis, Time: X-Axis

#### 301: Finance: Profit Center vs. Cost Center

## Boom & Bust Cycles

#### 330: Peacetime focus:

1. Hiring, Onboarding & Ramp-Up
2. Incubating new products
3. M&A

#### Wartime focus:

1. Reforecasting, Restructuring & Reorganizing
2. Layoffs - Do them all at once, no early warnings

## Career Development
