Hartmut Rosa's _Inavailability_ explores humanity's constant drive to make the world more accessible—through technology, money, and power. Rosa argues that true resonance, a feeling of living connection with the world, cannot be planned or forced.

**Top 3 Learnings:**

1. Resonance over Availability. Resonance cannot be forced; it remains open-ended, emerging through touch, self-efficacy, and can’t be generated by consumption or planning.

2. Dynamic Stabilization. Society is in a constant growth drive to avoid falling behind. This pursuit of “more,” however, leads to alienation and aggression.

3. Acceptance of Inavailability. True satisfaction lies in embracing partial availability—a balance between planning and letting things happen, requiring humility and self-acceptance.
