Seth Godin’s _This is Strategy_ presents a fresh perspective on strategic thinking by combining empathy, systems thinking, and long-term positioning. Instead of focusing solely on competition, Godin emphasizes building systems that create lasting change.

**Top 3 Learnings:**

1. **Strategy is about systems, not tactics.** Effective strategies work within existing systems rather than against them. Understanding feedback loops and leveraging the system’s inherent tendencies allows for sustainable impact.

2. **Choose your customers, competition, and distribution wisely.** Strategic positioning isn’t just about offering a product; it’s about selecting the right audience and channels while focusing on differentiation and long-term relationships.

3. **Change happens by design, not chance.** Successful strategies are intentional and rooted in awareness, empathy, resilience, and resource allocation. Building your own system that drives change is the ultimate goal.
