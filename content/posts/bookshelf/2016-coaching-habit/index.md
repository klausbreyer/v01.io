The book offers a practical approach to coaching in everyday conversations by emphasizing curiosity and effective questioning. Stanier provides seven key questions that help managers and leaders empower their teams, stay out of the advice-giving trap, and create meaningful change through better listening and reflection.

**Top 3 Learnings:**

1. Stay curious longer—resist the urge to jump to solutions and advice. Asking powerful, open-ended questions like "What's on your mind?" and "What’s the real challenge here for you?" encourages deeper thinking and ownership.
2. Saying yes to something means saying no to something else—using strategic questions helps clarify priorities and avoid overcommitment, leading to more intentional decision-making.
3. Effective coaching isn't about having the answers but about asking the right questions—questions that help individuals reflect, learn, and grow without feeling judged or micromanaged.
