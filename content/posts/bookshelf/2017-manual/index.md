This modern adaptation of Epictetus' Stoic teachings provides timeless wisdom on resilience, self-discipline, and acceptance. It emphasizes focusing on what we can control, letting go of attachments, and cultivating inner strength to navigate life's challenges with equanimity and purpose.

**Top 3 Learnings:**

1. Control what you can, accept what you can't—happiness comes from directing energy toward actions within our control while accepting external events with grace and composure.
2. Challenges are opportunities—when faced with difficulties, the key question is not "Why me?" but "Which strength can I apply to overcome this?"
3. True self-respect comes from living according to one's values—rather than seeking external validation, focus on aligning daily actions with personal principles and integrity.
