Solving a problem is easy. The hard part is about figuring out / defining the problem!
In this "problem-space" (pun intended) is my recent book recommendation (from 1990 - but its wisdom is not old.)

It is about working with problems. Because in the end, that is what we all do, day in and day out, when hacking code, developing products for customers, or managing people.

Favorite Takeaways:

- If you can't think of at least three things that might be wrong with your understanding of the problem, you need help understanding the problem.
- Each solution is the source of the next problem.
- The source of the problem is most often within you.
