![buddybrand Farewell](IMG_1826-1024x579.jpg)

After over 5 years, I have stepped down from my position as Technical Managing Director of buddybrand.

buddybrand has transformed over the past few years from a technical service provider to one of Germany's top addresses for social media and especially content. I have actively helped shape this journey for over 5 years. Now, however, this incredibly amazing time is coming to an end for me, because I want to venture into something new once again.

Currently, I am looking for business models that are seeking a Business Angel or co-founder, and I am developing my own new ideas in parallel.

Until I pursue one of my new ideas full-time, I am available as a freelance CTO. You can hire me hands-on as a programmer for websites, blogs, and apps, and for technical problems with Facebook of any kind. I also very much enjoy advising on classic CTO tasks such as technology strategy, developing prototypes/MVPs, and building developer teams.

So I'm becoming self-employed for the second time. To keep it entertaining for the interested reader, I want to write a lot about it. For this, I have set myself the following "values."

#### Hands on

You can think up many business ideas on the drawing board. But the best thing is something that also brings you personal benefit. And that's exactly where my focus will lie now: I need to set up my own accounting, connect as an entrepreneur with potential business partners, and acquire potential customers as a freelancer. In doing so, I not only have the challenge of building everything "from scratch," but also the opportunity to question everything that exists today in terms of products and services for this purpose – and who knows, maybe a useful business idea will emerge from that.

#### Data-driven

Before I desperately tell all people on Xing and LinkedIn about my new self-employment to desperately get freelance assignments, I want to proceed more intelligently in the future. Namely, more data-driven. By this I don't mean that I set absolute numbers as goals and measure my success by them, but that I experiment much more (though consciously). Before I implement something, I want to formulate hypotheses about why something can work and how I recognize success. Then I want to evaluate the experiment, learn from it, and do it better next time. Martin Szugat aka [Datentreiber](http://datentreiber.de/) explains this very well [in a talk](http://de.slideshare.net/Datentreiber/vom-datengetriebenen-unternehmen-zum-datentreiber).

#### Transparent

Everything I do, how I structure my freelance work, which ideas and companies I work with, should be documented here in the blog. However, I don't want to document every project diary-style now, but rather the meta-level. Above all, I want to discuss my hypotheses and approaches and perhaps be pointed to one or another thing that I have forgotten.

So – that's it for now. Let's get started.
