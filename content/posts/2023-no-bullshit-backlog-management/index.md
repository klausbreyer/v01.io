None of the teams I ever worked with had the courage to remove (currently) irrelevant tickets from the backlog. Too often, there was the fear of forgetting something. So the teams end up with a very long backlog of things that are neither important nor urgent, but where the implicit expectation is that they are getting done - sometimes. But sometimes never comes - and I'm not particularly eager to sweep such tickets under the carpet.

In a video conference organized by [Ryan][1] and some early Shape Up Adopters, I learned something essential about Backlog management:

> It is crucial to distinguish between **"small"** (but not urgent) work and **"reactive"** (super urgent) work.

1\. Batch **small** tickets around themes that make sense to have them together. And then, the team can frame/shape/deliver them as usual within a given appetite via [Shape Up][2].

2\. Take care of **reactive** work and critical bugs immediately! If a bug is not critical but "acceptable," it is not a bug but an improvement (called [Zero Bug Development][3], by the way). And if it is an improvement, it goes together with the rest of the small tickets - in a larger batch when there is the time for it.

With this in mind, the daily look into the (growing) backlog is no longer daunting:

- A bug ticket is crucial and it is okay to drop other work.
- It is also clear that there will be the right time and place to take care of all the small work.
