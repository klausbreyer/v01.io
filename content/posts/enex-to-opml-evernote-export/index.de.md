Whoever (like me) is currently migrating from [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/de/) to [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/invite/2ede5294.lnx)* would like to take their notes with them. Unfortunately Evernote is quite closed about that. So I wrote a small command line tool in Node to convert the unspeakable XML of the .enex files into cleaner .ompl for Workflowy.
  ## Features
- Each note title becomes a Workflowy entry.
- Note content and HTML (stripped) are used for note content.


I wrote it in Node.js and then published it [as npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enex-to-opml). The repository [at github](https://github.com/klausbreyer/enex-to-opml).
  ## Installation
To use it you only need Node.JS and of course npm. Then you can install it like this:

```
npm install enex-to-opml -g
```

 ## summary
The use is just as easy. Just go to the folder with your .enex files exported from Evernote and call the script with them as parameters.

```
cd /path/to/your/evernote-exports/ enex-to-ompl export.enex
```

You will get an export.ompl file, which you can copy and paste into Workflowy.
