I had the pleasure of hearing [James Stanier](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/) speak at a conference, and his insights on remote work stuck with me. That's why I highly recommend his book "Effective Remote Work." In it, Stanier argues that remote work without an emphasis on asynchronous work modes is just like working in a physical office, but with all the downsides amplified.

To truly thrive in a remote work environment, we must embrace methods promoting autonomy and allowing for flexible schedules. Stanier's book contains practical tips for making remote work successful and enjoyable, even facing challenges like time zones and communication barriers.

(It is focused on engineers, but my wife also took a lot out of it for their job to digitally transform government work.)
