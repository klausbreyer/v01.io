Simple script that generates a summary from a labelled Trello list. Very simple changelogs for agile sprints.

At the first start you will be asked for a trello app key and a trello user token. You do not need to enter them again when you restart the program.

After that you will be asked for a board and a list of the board. As a result you get all cards of the selected list - grouped by labels.
