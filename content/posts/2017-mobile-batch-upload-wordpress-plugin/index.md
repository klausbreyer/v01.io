This is a useful little Wordpress plugin for uploading an unlimited number of images from the mobile admin interface and publishing them in a single post.

With a little patience you can do this directly with the admin interface, but this plugin comes with a killer feature: It rotates the images uploaded from the iPhone the right way around. There is [a stupid bug, which makes sure that images uploaded from the mobile safari are not rotated correctly by default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27673102/how-to-make-a-file-input-upload-the-original-image-file-instead-of-forcing-conve). Even the mobile editor of Wordpress can't do that.

The plugin is [listed in the Wordpress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/moba/) and can be installed directly in Wordpress like any other plugin. [The whole thing is of course Open Source](https://github.com/klausbreyer/moba). I appreciate feedback in the form of feature requests!
