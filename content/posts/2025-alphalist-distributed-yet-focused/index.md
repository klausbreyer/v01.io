I taught a masterclass for CTOs of the [alphalist](https://alphalist.com) community:

**Distributed, Yet Focused – High-Impact Remote Teams**

Remote work isn’t a challenge – it’s an advantage.  
But offices create culture by accident. Remote teams need to design it on purpose.

We’ll talked about:

🧭 How async communication, sync rituals, and clear expectations make the difference  
📊 Why visibility ≠ productivity – and what to measure instead  
🤝 How intentional culture fosters real belonging  
💸 And why a few more great people might be better than an office lease

This talk is built on real experiments: from founding startups to transforming corporates, including my current work leading product and tech at edding AG. You'll get practical rituals, team habits, and leadership patterns that help distributed teams focus, connect, and perform.
