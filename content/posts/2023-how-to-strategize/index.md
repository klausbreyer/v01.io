Rejecting the normative constraints of static PowerPoint presentations and the rigid frameworks reminiscent of ancient temples, my approach to startup strategy embraces clarity and divergence. It's not just about standing out; it's about being _contrarian_!

## Being contrarian

In the startup realm, differentiation isn't merely about being unique; it's about adopting a contrarian stance. This means crafting a narrative that underlines a startup's distinct position, not just in opposition to others but as a pioneer in new spaces.

## Blue Ocean Strategy

The concept of [Blue Ocean Strategy](https://amzn.to/47EIo3i) centers on creating new market areas, making competition irrelevant. It's a shift from battling in saturated markets (Red Oceans) to exploring and dominating new ones (Blue Oceans). This strategy urges startups to innovate and generate demand in uncharted territories.

## 'More of, Less of': A Pragmatic Framework

I advocate for the 'More of, Less of' framework to articulate a startup's unique position. This approach involves choosing extremes, like emphasizing 'more asynchronous collaboration and less real-time interaction,' to carve a distinct niche. The method is exemplified in ["Position, Position, Position"](https://m.signalvnoise.com/position-position-position/), showcasing practical strategic positioning.

## Executing Strategy

The real challenge lies in strategy execution. It requires initiatives perfectly aligned with the strategic vision, each led by a dedicated owner. This ensures that the strategy is more than a statement â€” it's an integral part of the company's operations and decisions.

If you remember just one thing from this post: _The strategic narrative must be so engaging and straightforward that everyone in the organization, from the CEO to the latest intern, can grasp and express it with ease._
