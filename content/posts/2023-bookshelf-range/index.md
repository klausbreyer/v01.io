"Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World" holds much personal meaning for me as I have held many diverse responsible positions from a young age. I struggled with not having an explicit professional specialization (like being the Goto-Guru for this or the other thing) for a long time. Still, slowly I am recognizing how much I have benefited from being a generalist and being able to puzzle situations together and drive them forward.

One of the key takeaways from this book is that only through taking action can we truly learn who we are, rather than just thinking about an ideal "should be" future. The author argues that it's about more than just working towards a specific goal but moving forward from promising situations.

I highly recommend "Range" to anyone grappling with the idea of being a generalist in a specialized world. It's a refreshing and inspiring read that challenges conventional thinking about career paths and success
