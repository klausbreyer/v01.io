Imagine this: your favorite YouTube content creators have just uploaded a series of insightful podcasts. But there's a catch â€“ they're all in video format. This is a familiar scenario in our digital age, where engaging audio content is often locked within visual media, posing a challenge for those with limited screen time or a preference for audio.

## Bridging the Gap: From Visual to Audio

Ever since I started using ChatGPT for coding, I've been spotting GPT-4 sized holes everywhere that I swiftly patch up.
Recognizing this gap I just described above, I've crafted a straightforward yet powerful PHP script: [Folder Feeder](https://github.com/klausbreyer/folder-feeder). This tool is a bridge, transforming any collection of audio files into a podcast feed. It's particularly effective for converting YouTube videos into podcast episodes, enabling seamless enjoyment of these videos, akin to traditional podcasts in your personal playlist.

1. **Accessing the Script**: Visit your web server directory where `index.php` is located.
2. **Acquiring the Feed URL**: Use this directory URL as your new podcast feed.

### Step 4: Enjoying Your Podcast

1. **Adding to Your Player**: In your podcast player, add a new podcast using a URL.
2. **Feed URL Insertion**: Paste the previously obtained feed URL.
3. **Listening Experience**: Your audio files now appear as individual podcast episodes.
