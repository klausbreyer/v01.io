A little book by Seth Godin (I love short, concise books, by the way!).

Well, the title says it all. In the book, Seth introduces the concept of a "dip" that everyone goes through in their creative/entrepreneurial endeavor. The difficulty is recognizing whether you are in a dip or a hopeless situation.

Besides that, my most important takeaway is: The opposite of "to stop" is not "to wait."
