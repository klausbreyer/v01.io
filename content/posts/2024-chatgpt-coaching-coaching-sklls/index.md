I know how important solid coaching skills are for any leader. Honestly, though, I'm still learningâ€”and always looking to improve. I think we all do, and I had an epiphany today.

Sometimes, it's tough to translate my intentions into practical coaching questions, especially when I'm in the thick of team challenges, maybe even frustrated or emotionally attached.

So, I decided to try something new: I turned to ChatGPT for support in refining my coaching approach, which I mostly learned from Michael Bungay Stanier's books The Coaching Habit and The Advice Trap.

My Prompt:
> I work with these coaching principles from The Advice Trap by Michael Bungay Stanier, 2020<space><space>
> what questions to ask
> - Kickstart: What's on your mind?
> - AWE: And What else?
> - Focus: What's the real challenge here for you?
> - Foundation: What do you want?
> - Strategy: If you're saying yes to this, what must you say no to?
> - Lazy: How can I help?
> - Learning: What was most useful or valuable here for you?
> Ask Questions well
> - Ask one question at a time
> - Cut the Interruptions
> - No rhetorical questions / advice as questions
> - Stick to Questions with "What"
> - Get comfortable with silence
> - Actually, listen to the answer
> - Acknowledge the answers you get
> - Use any and every channel to ask a question
> Now, I have something bothering me about my current team
> -Some blurp of complaints
> I already came up with a set of coaching questions
> -My coaching questions
> But you may have some other ideas. Transform my emotional complaints into more questions I can use to coach the team members effectively.

> Then ChatGpt responds with:

1. What motivated you to adjust the \[..\] process in this way?
2. What is the most important goal behind this decision for you?
3. What would be the most significant benefit to the team if we further develop \[..\]?"
4. How could we better assess which steps are necessary within \[..\] and which should be handled separately?
5. What might help us make our progress more transparent for everyone involved?
6. In what ways could we improve communication to \[..\]?
7. What could a collaborative approach look like for discussing \[..\]?
8. What do we need as structure or format to discuss topics like this in a focused way and make decisions together?

**Yes!**

**This is something I can work with!**

I had some ideas on how to approach this specific issue in a coach-y way. I came up with roughly half of it by myself, but the others were genuinely inspiring. I think it is essential to come up with some coaching questions yourself first:

- This is the only way you really can learn coaching by yourself
- Examples are very important for ChatGPT
- Using ChatGPT to fill in the blanks is best for those models. (It is how they are trained, though!)
