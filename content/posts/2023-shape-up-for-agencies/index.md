Two different agency worlds. In the first, designers and developers hustle, juggling multiple client projects, always feeling the pressure of looming deadlines. In the second, there's a noticeable contrast. There is a structured flow, with teams confidently navigating client work.

The difference? The latter agency has embraced the Shape Up methodology. Originally designed for product development, how can Shape Up be the game-changer in the volatile world of agency work? Let's delve in and find out."

### Why Shape Up? And Why Clients Should Opt for Shape Up

Shape Up emerges as a beacon in a landscape of product development. Its main emphasis is on continuous de-risking, aligning projects with the client's vision, and efficient resource utilization. By integrating clients into the process, it fosters _transparency, collaboration, and synchronization_. The allure of Shape Up lies in its _commitment_: although the exact nature of the outcome might evolve, the _promise of a tangible deliverable remains constant_.

### Crafting the Perfect Setup

- **Trust the Team**: Clients must trust the capabilities of designers and developers.
- **Project Scale**: For Shape Up's effectiveness, projects should be at least 2 weeks in duration.
- **Dynamic Duos**: Ideally, projects should be handled by teams of two.
- **Versatile Designers**: Seek well-rounded designers instead of isolated UX and UI specialists. Ideally proficient in HTML and CSS to a production-grade (, though not necessarily JavaScript).
- **Robust Product Teams**: Essential during shaping. Otherwise, clients might inadvertently steer the project without appropriate de-risking.
- **Leadership Buy-In**: Given its cross-functional nature, adopting Shape Up requires top-level support from the client side.
- **Continuous Learning and Application**: Mastery and consistent application of the methodology are crucial. It will not be perfect on the first try.

### Client-Agency Relationship with Shape Up

**Client Involvement in Shaping**: Engaging clients in the shaping process enhances their buy-in and fosters trust.

**Setting Expectations**: Collaborating with clients heightens the need to set clear expectations, because there are on a fixed budget. A sincere "no" can often be more beneficial, building trust by avoiding overcommitment.

**Product Managers over Project Managers**: It's pivotal to have product managers guiding the vision instead of merely managing tasks.

**Focused Leadership Teams**: A fixed team responsible for shaping a client's project should comprise a developer (technical shaper) and product specialist, continually refining client objectives.

**Outcome Guarantee**: If timelines extend, the agency bears the extra costs, ensuring clients always receive the promised outcome.

**Time Pressure and Trade-offs**: Fixed deadlines ensure essential trade-offs are made.

**Pitch as Part of the Contract**: The initial pitch becomes a component of the agreement, integrating the client's vision from the onset.

**Shaping as Negotiation**: With client involvement, shaping becomes a negotiation about what's feasible within a set timeframe, fostering mutual understanding and respect. And thats a good thing.

**New Ideas During Shaping**: Instead of expanding the scope of the current cycle when new ideas arise, the agency might suggest pitching a new concept, albeit at a cost.

**Visual Design at the End**: Finalizing the visual design at the project's conclusion ensures optimal time utilization and guarantees a functional project with a superior user experience.

**Backlog Management**: It's essential to gather what the client wishes to have, but also to agree on how available hours will be spent before commencing the work.

### A Practical Example

[In this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anDSoLKtHyo), Ryan Singer, the creator of Shape Up, discusses with a dev shop owner about implementing Shape Up in client work.

Their process is distilled to these steps:

1. **Discovery Phase**: A 30-minute introductory call is followed by a 2-hour discovery session. During this time, with the involvement of the client's founder or top management, all ideas are collated. Often, once noted, some ideas might not be revisited.
2. **Shaping Phase**: The agency team dedicates time to outline problems, potential solutions, sketches, and pinpoint potential challenges. The ultimate question posed is, "What does success look like?"
3. After two weeks, clients are presented with a series of pitches / packages, each spanning six weeks.
4. **Building Phase**: Monitoring hours is crucial. For instance, a two-week project might translate to 60 hours spread across different tasks. Clients are updated, empowering them to make budget-conscious trade-offs.
5. **Business Model**: At the conclusion, clients are offered fixed product durations of two-week, four-week, or six-week cycles, and a maintenance subscription.
6. **Maintenance Subscription:** The agency accumulates client requests, gauges time needs, and collaborates at the beginning of the month to determine how the designated 20 hours will be allocated.

In closing, for agencies navigating the crossroads of innovation and delivery, Shape Up can be the guiding star. It promises _structured flexibility, client engagement, trust, and guaranteed results_. With Shape Up, an agency can distinguish itself in a competitive marketplace.
