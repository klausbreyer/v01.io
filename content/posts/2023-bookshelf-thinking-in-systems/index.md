My book recommendation for this week is about System Thinking. Why is it relevant? Feedback loops are everywhere. --> It's not about who is at fault. It's about understanding the system. Dynamic systems cannot be understood via statistical correlations. (This can only ever be used to map the past but cannot produce strong statements about the future. ) Systems cannot be mastered or wholly understood. -> You have to "dance" with them, and you can shape your sphere of influence correctly.

In the end, there is no single truth. On the one hand, the world is not linear, but on the other hand, system boundaries are also messy.
