I recently joined Zuzi Sochova’s **#AgileWay** podcast for a short and sharp conversation on agile practices in interdisciplinary teams — with a nod to my upcoming talk at [AgilePrague](https://agileprague.com/).

In the podcast, I hint at what I’ll be doing live in Prague: provoking a room full of certified Scrum practitioners by challenging the idea of tickets. I’ll show how they create silos — and what truly collaborative software development can look like instead.

Curious? Listen in:
