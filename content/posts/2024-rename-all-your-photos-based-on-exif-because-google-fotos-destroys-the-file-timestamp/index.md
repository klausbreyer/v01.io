Google Photos often alters the original file timestamp during uploads, making it difficult to organize photos chronologically. To solve this issue, I created [rename-all-your-photos-based-on-exif-because-google-fotos-destroys-the-file-timestamp](https://github.com/klausbreyer/rename-all-your-photos-based-on-exif-because-google-fotos-destroys-the-file-timestamp), a script that renames photos based on EXIF metadata, preserving the original capture date in the filename.
