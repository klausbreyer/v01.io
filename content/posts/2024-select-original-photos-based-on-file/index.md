Apple’s Shared Albums are convenient for photo sharing but often reduce image resolution, which can be problematic when you need the original quality. To address this, I’ve developed [select-original-photos-based-on-file-names-because-Apple-s-shared-photo-albums-reduce-resolution](https://github.com/klausbreyer/select-original-photos-based-on-file-names-because-Apple-s-shared-photo-albums-reduce-resolution), a shell script that helps you retrieve original photos based on filenames from a reference directory.

[select-original-photos-based-on-file-names-because-Apple-s-shared-photo-albums-reduce-resolution](https://github.com/klausbreyer/select-original-photos-based-on-file-names-because-Apple-s-shared-photo-albums-reduce-resolution) works by comparing filenames in your reference folder with those in your input folder, identifying and copying the original files to a designated output folder. This ensures you maintain the highest quality versions of your photos, even after sharing.
