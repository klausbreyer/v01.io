This is a short case study regarding the prototyping mindset of one of my projects. It is called [Fillter.me](http://fillter.me) (currently only available in German).

Felix and OÄŸuz were victims of their success and drowned in many (poorly written!!) inquiries from brands and agencies with their Creator Management [YilmazHummel](http://yilmazhummel.com).

So they developed a unique question technique on their homepage with WordPress forms to better fill inbound inquiries for themselves (pun intended).

So there is a market, a pain point, and an already proven low fi solution: A good time to develop a business model.

We then jointly developed a generic and scalable Software as a Service to replace the existing individual solution last year.

Since February, this has been used at [YilmazHummel](http://yilmazhummel.com) and a small circle of initial beta testers.

Now we feel ready to open the circle of beta testers a bit more.

[So if you are a creator yourself and are tired of working your way through many (unpromising) copy & paste requests from brands every day, feel free to watch Felix's video on the homepage and then join our waiting list.](http://fillter.me)
