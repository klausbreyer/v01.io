I highly recommend "Plays Well with Others," a captivating non-fiction book that provides a fresh perspective on why much of what we know about relationships is (mostly) wrong, including commonly held beliefs like "don't judge a book by its cover" and "love conquers all." The author meticulously examines these notions through scientific studies, offering invaluable insights for personal and professional growth.
Takeaway: The biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has occurred.
