It is about: empathic perspective, uncovering demand, causal structures, prototyping to learn, and making trade-offs.

Every single one of those topics is probably not a news flash - but they were completely redefined for me through this book.

For example: When he talks about prototyping, he does not think of a/b tests - he rather thinks of building an orthogonal array of experiments to test all possible variations of a problem at once!
This is something completely different, then "iterating" on a product.

The same goes for the other 4 topics. There is a lot to unpack behind those words and a lot of wisdom in this book.
