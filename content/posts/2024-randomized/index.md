Organizing workshops and group activities often requires randomizing participant lists to ensure fairness and engagement. To facilitate this, Iâ€™ve developed [randomized](https://github.com/klausbreyer/randomized), a Go-based web application that shuffles and displays names in a random order. This tool is particularly useful for assigning tasks, forming teams, or selecting individuals randomly during events.

[randomized](https://github.com/klausbreyer/randomized) operates as a web server, allowing users to input a list of names via the URL. You can try it out on the live example [here](https://randomized.fly.dev/). Upon accessing the specified route, the application processes the names and presents them in a randomly shuffled sequence on a simple HTML page. This ensures an unbiased and transparent method for random selection, enhancing the interactive experience in group settings.
