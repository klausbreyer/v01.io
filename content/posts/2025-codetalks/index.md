Today I’m speaking at the code.talks conference in Hamburg!

Software development isn’t a manufacturing line, where one group mindlessly executes what another has decided. It’s an interdisciplinary design process. Yet in many organizations, ticket systems, overloaded Kanban boards, and rigid roles create silos that slow everything down. 

This session explores how small, interdisciplinary teams with real ownership can move fast and deliver quality at scale. It also examines how leaders and individual contributors can enable this at every level. 

We break down key structures, habits, and reporting methods into actionable insights. Instead of introducing another framework, the talk returns to first principles and shows how to create the conditions for empowered, collaborative teams and organizations.

Everything is based on practical experience from startup exits to corporate transformation, including current work leading product and tech at edding.
