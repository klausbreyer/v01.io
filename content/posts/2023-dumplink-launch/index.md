### Key Features of dumplink

1. **Dump**: Break down a project into an unstructured list of tasks. This phase allows for a free-flowing collection of all tasks, mirroring the brainstorming stage of a project.

2. **Cluster**: Organize this list into task groups. By clustering tasks, teams can see natural groupings and dependencies, aiding in more strategic planning.

3. **Sequence**: Arrange the task groups in a logical sequence. This helps in identifying the order in which tasks should be tackled, aligning with the project's overall timeline.

4. **Arrange**: Get a structured data visualization of the task groups as an unfolded network. This visual representation provides a clear overview of the project's structure, making it easier to manage and navigate.

5. **Set Appetites and See Risk Ratios**: Quickly assess progress risk, from unsolved to solved phases. This feature allows teams to align their efforts with the project's 'appetite' or time budget, making strategic decisions about scope and priorities.
