I recently found out that not everyone in tech is using ChatGPT daily. That surprised me. Software development is a fast-paced game. It's not just about cranking out code; it's about solving problems efficiently. And ChatGPT has been a game-changer for me in that regard.

Here are the examples with the most impact in my daily development and product work:

**1. Unix Sorcery and Shellscripts:** From AWS commands, sed, jq to modifying makefiles for different operating systems, ChatGPT has been a beacon of knowledge. Tasks that once felt like insurmountable challenges are now tackled with finesse and precision.

**2. JIRA Queries:** Crafting the perfect JIRA query can be daunting. With directives like `project = HYX and issuetype not in [Epic] ORDER BY Rank ASC`, ChatGPT steps in to optimize and rectify queries, ensuring project management runs smoother than ever.

**3. GitHub Actions:** Whether it's orchestrating tests based on the fly.io template or invoking other actions before deployment, ChatGPT has proven indispensable. I've presented ChatGPT with GitHub Actions examples, sparing the nitty-gritty details, and with a sprinkle of context from my project, it works wonders.

**4. ESLint:** Have you ever needed to augment your ESLINT config to block certain module imports? ChatGPT is at your service.

**5. FFmpeg:** FFmpeg, while powerful, can be intricate. ChatGPT demystifies it, offering a user-friendly interface that assists in tasks like generating screenshots from a collection of MP4 files.

**6. Documentation and API Integration:** Channeling documentation and APIs into GPT-4 to craft interfaces sounds surreal. Yet, with ChatGPT, this dream morphs into reality.

**7. Translation and Product Localization:** In our globalized marketplace, localization is paramount. ChatGPT facilitates translation and ensures the product's core essence remains unaltered across languages.

**8. Hugo:** Got a German blog post that needs translation to English without disrupting the markdown format? Are you looking for pertinent tags for your content? ChatGPT has you covered.

**9. Google Spreadsheet Formulas:** For those grappling with the complexities of Google spreadsheet formulas, ChatGPT emerges as a lifesaver.

**10. Kubernetes (k8s) Operations:** Grasping the k8s concept is one thing; handling the tool is another. With ChatGPT, even the intricacies of tools like k8s become manageable.

**11. Code Architecture:** When I ventured to develop a project in Go, sans a framework, I encountered challenges in template organization. I aspired for a structure reminiscent of React with a child parameter. ChatGPT not only illuminated the path but also inspired innovative ideas.

In short, ChatGPT isn't just another tool. It's a reliable sidekick that makes my work better and easier. It's not just about doing more; it's about understanding more and creating better solutions. If you're in tech, you should give it a try. It could change the way you work.
