![Shoulder Ligament Rupture](schulter.png)

When you've had a traffic accident like I did, where the right [upper arm bone tears the ligaments of the shoulder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromioclavicular_joint_dislocation), it not only takes a very long time until you can operate a computer with both hands again, but much more changes as well. Well. Anyway, I can now operate a computer again and with it, what changes came along in my life.

- In digital everyday life, you learn to appreciate the iPad as an important work tool. Direct touching is so much easier than operating the mouse with the left hand. And thanks to autocorrect, typing with one hand on the iPad is much faster than on the keyboard.
- You learn to brush your teeth with your left hand. There's no way around it. I haven't found any hack or help for that. That was the hardest part.
- Your bread rolls have to be cut open for you. Spreading butter works just about. But cream cheese is better.
- You can no longer tie shoelaces, but use [Lock Laces\*](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00DGFF82G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B00DGFF82G&linkCode=as2&tag=mobizzle-21&linkId=PANXBLIQW5EUUU6D).
- You're not allowed to carry backpacks anymore.
- Bags are also complicated. Because if you only have a bag or plastic bag with you, you already have no free hand left.
- You mainly wear pants with many pockets.
- Preferably short and wide-cut pants. Regardless of the temperature.
- Because you can only put on jeans with one hand under immense effort and pain. You can't even reach the right pants pocket anymore.
- On the other hand, you usually have a lot of space on the train due to the [orthosis](http://www.sporlastic.de/de/pdf/07255.pdf) that immobilizes the shoulder.
- Except sometimes, then not. And then it really annoys you.
- You watch the concert of your favorite death metal band more from the back than from the front.
- You learn that Sp√§ti vendors in Kreuzberg are more helpful than cashiers in Mitte.
- Nevertheless, you prefer to buy drinks with pop-top closures instead of crown caps.
- You can no longer grate Parmesan, but buy it in ready-made powder form. And are disappointed every time again.

But the worst thing about it is that you can't do anything except do nothing. And then you also have to accept help! And sometimes you don't feel like it. But you quickly regret it.
