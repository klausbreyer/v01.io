I taught a masterclass for CTOs of the [alphalist](https://alphalist.com) community:

**Move Fast and Break Silos - Leading Interdisciplinary Teams and Organizations**

- 🎨 Software isn’t manufacturing with specialized disciplines—it is supposed to be an interdisciplinary design process.
- 🎟️ But tickets create silos, short cycles with big teams lead to micromanagement, and endless Kanban columns drain energy.
- ✂️ Slicing the work differently—around objectives, problems, solutions, and delivery—changes everything.
- 🔄 Design and scale interdisciplinary small teams, ownership, and habit-enforcing reporting structures.
- 💙 Emancipate teams by giving real people real ownership and setting the stage for success.

Klaus, leading Product & Technology at edding, shares insights from leading interdisciplinary teams—from his startups to exit and corporate transformation. Today, the methods, tools, and principles all exist, but change often feels too drastic and transformation stalls. This talk breaks concepts down into first principles and comes with practical, easy-to-try experiments.
