I am a startup founder and experienced CPTO who breaks silos by empowering organizations to seamlessly integrate product and technology while enabling leadership teams to cultivate a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration. As an interim manager or advisor, I help companies bridge the gap between technical excellence, agile product development, and impactful leadership.

For me, it’s not about code; it’s about weaving the tech fabric into the company’s culture — whether for agencies, SMEs, or fledgling startups. Over the last 15 years, I have built a proven track record in product and tech leadership, founding startups, and building business units.

Below, I’ve categorized some of the things I’ve done: Teams that innovate and Projects that matter.

Move Fast And Break Silos!
