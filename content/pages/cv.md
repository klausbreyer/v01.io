Hello, I'm Klaus Breyer, a _technology leader_ with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and over a decade of experience in building and managing effective teams. From kickstarting my entrepreneurial journey in 2010 with my first startup to taking on the _CTO/CTPO_ roles in numerous ventures, I've been instrumental in driving technological innovation and excellence.

I've anchored my beliefs in [Shape Up]({{< relref "/tags/shapeup/" >}}), the next wave of agile.

What do I bring to the table? _Strategy and technical prowess_. It’s not about coding; it’s about laying the foundation for products that make a mark. And doing it in sync with the business side of things.

1. _Startup strategy_ – turning ideas into impactful ventures.
1. Selling the _tech vision_ – whether it's to investors or stakeholders.
1. _Prototyping & crafting_ the first version of a product from scratch, if need be.
1. Assembling and nurturing a _killer team_.
1. Bringing _product & engineering processes_ up to speed.

From startup _monoliths_ to large _microservice_ environments, I've led and launched.

But beyond the tech, I build infrastructures that empower.

Teams that innovate.

Projects that matter.
I've penned down my thoughts in [articles]({{< ref "/posts/" >}}) and shared them out loud at [conferences]({{< relref "appearances" >}}). Whether it's a page or a stage, I'm there. With a voice in the tech community, I am more than just a leader; I am an influencer, continually _bridging the gap between technology, product, and business_.

> &raquo; Good software is always used but never finished.&laquo;

That's all.

## Founding & Management Experience

Throughout my career, I've led the development and launch of numerous cutting-edge projects in _modern web stacks_. I pride myself on my ability to balance technical excellence with a strategic vision, enabling my teams to focus on solving problems that truly matter and delivering value to users.

As the Technical Lead at [Hydro Pocket](https://hydropocket.com/), the first end-customer product of the industrial company GmbH & Co. KGaA, I built the tech team from scratch within this new business unit and introduced the [Shape Up]({{< relref "/tags/shapeup/" >}}) method.

### [BuzzBird GmbH](https://www.buzzbird.de/)

**Role:** _Founder and Chief Technology & Product Officer_

**Industry:** Influencer Marketplace

**Period:** 2016 – 2018

We embarked on an exciting journey with the goal of making social media influencers programmatically bookable - similar to Google Ads. This challenge sparked innovation, leading to the development of sophisticated software, which is now primarily used internally. This software effectively digitalizes the influencer process, acting as an "Influencer Agency on Steroids."

Key features of our system include a billing system, a matching algorithm, and an influencer inventory management module. Furthermore, it encourages transparency and data-driven decisions by enabling social media creators to share their statistics.

### [buddybrand GmbH](https://buddybrand.com/)

**Role:** _Founder and managing technical director_

**Industry:** digital agency

**Period:** 2010 – 2015

Right out of university, I started building Facebook apps as a freelancer with my co-founders – just at the right time. Even before I could hand in my bachelor thesis, we had earned enough money to start a GmbH. In the next 3 years alone, we built several hundred Facebook apps and grew from cash flow to 30+ employees. Nowadays, buddybrand is a full-service digital creative agency these days.

## Consulting, Startup Advisory & Side Projects

In addition to my professional experience, I'm also a dedicated entrepreneur and startup investor. I develop and market projects on the side and support early-stage companies through money or time. I'm also committed to giving back to the [open-source]({{< ref "/categories/open-source" >}}) community and have contributed to several projects.

### [Ray Sono AG](https://www.raysono.com/)

**Role:** _Technology Principal_ (freelance)

**Industry:** Technology and Industrial Solutions

**Period:** 2019 – Now

As a Technology Principal, I am involved in projects from the initial conceptual brainstorming stage to the eventual implementation, using either internal or external resources. In larger projects, I take on the role of Tech Lead, overseeing a development team. I perform these duties on-site with the Berlin team or remotely with an international team of developers.

### [touch361](https://touch361.org/)

**Role:** Startup Advisor

**Industry:** Business Intelligence Software

**Period:** 2019 – Now

I am a technical sparring partner for founders with marketing and business intelligence as their focus. The challenges we tackle here focus on data protection / DSGVO and the product development process with the technical service provider.

### [vitalfunktion GmbH](https://www.whatsinmymeds.de/)

**Role:** Startup Adivsor

**Industry:** Pharma Tech

**Period:** 2018 – Now

The startup’s main product is a really smooth-to-use app for medication intolerances. I am sparring with the founder Maximilian (pharmacist), weekly for product development and monetization. Currently, we have a solid number of several thousand MAU (Monthly Active Users) and refinance the app through fixed advertising cooperations in the pharmaceutical industry.

In addition, there is also a B2B variant (planned initially as a pivot) aimed at doctors and pharmacists. I developed the prototype in Material UI and still maintain the product today.

### [Fillter](https://www.fillter.me/)

**Role:** Co-founder & CTPO

**Industry:** Social Media Tools

**Period:** 2021 – 2023

Fillter is a form for all social media creator requests. They link Fillter in their link tree, Instagram bio, or website. Through a unique questioning technique, the requests come as usual via email – only in good.

The tool is a joint venture with [Felix and Oğuz](https://yilmazhummel.com/). We all work hands-on as equal co-founders, with our individual skills, to bring the project to the world.

### [unixtime.app](https://www.unixtime.app)

**Role:** Founder

**Industry:** Developer Tools

**Period:** 2022 – 2023

A tool designed for API developers to facilitate bulk timestamp conversion. The idea was born out of my work as a Tech Lead in an IIoT microservice context where data, coded as Unix timestamps, was plentiful. I sought to streamline my workflow, crafting a tool that let me bypass the laborious task of individually selecting timestamps for conversion in external services. Now, I can simply copy entire API requests into unixtime.app and view all timestamps directly within their context. The tool also allows me to capture screenshots of the conversions, useful for sharing in collaborative spaces like Slack or JIRA. What started as a straightforward HTML file has evolved into a full-fledged application for Mac and Windows and is now open source.

### cloudlog

**Role:** Solopreneuer Project

**Industry:** Developer Tools

**Period:** 2020 – 2021

Remote times necessitate remote tools. Cloudlog.dev is a tool designed for frontend developers. It allows them to stream the `console.log` output from any remote browser in real-time directly into their own developer console.

### Fotando GmbH

**Role:** Founder and Chief Prototyping Officer

**Industry:** E-commerce

**Period:** 2018 – 2019

We had noticed that most photo printing vendors always send their customers to ugly, bloated, slow native apps, which in turn also always had ugly ad conversions as they sent users to the AppStore. So the challenge was clear: we need a customer journey where the user can upload, crop, and edit their photo in the mobile browser and then (after delivery) hang it on the wall (claim: from hand to the wall!). Technically, it worked great that way, too. However, at that time, the company slid into the first Corona wave shortly before it was financed. In retrospect: Pretty stupid – for all parties.

### [Native Studios UG](https://www.native-studios.com/)

**Role:** _Technical Evangelist & Tech Lead_ (interim)

**Industry:** SaaS

**Period:** 2016 – 2019

I built [several iterations of a prototype](https://your-link-to-the-case-study-here.com) for the founders in 2016 and 2017 until they could convince backers and first customers with it.

Afterward, I was Tech Lead for product development and Technical Evangelist to convince customers of the startup’s technology and capabilities.
