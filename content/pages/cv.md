I'm Klaus Breyer. With [a lifetime in tech]({{< relref "/pages/cv" >}}), a degree in Software Engineering, and a passion for innovation, I went from founding my first startup in 2010 to playing key roles as CTO/CTPO in many others.

I've anchored my beliefs in [Shape Up]({{< relref "/tags/shapeup/" >}}), the next wave of agile.

I turn visionary business goals into concrete results, with focused expertise at the intersection of product and tech organization.
It's not merely about coding; it's about crafting standout products that make a mark and drive business forward.

1. Startup strategy & product-market fit â€“ turning ideas into impactful ventures.
1. Selling the tech vision â€“ whether it's to investors or stakeholders.
1. Prototyping & Crafting the first version of a product from scratch, if need be.
1. Assembling and Nurturing a Killer Team â€“ Remote or in Berlin, transitioning from chaotic ad-hoc development to structured product delivery cadence.
1. Bringing product & engineering processes up to speed - fostering asynchronous collaboration.

Tech, product, business â€“ that's where I thrive.

For me it is not about code, it's about weaving the tech fabric into the company's culture.

For agencies, SME or fledgling startups - Teams that innovate and Projects that matter.

> Start, Iterate, Fight Bullshit.

That is my Motto and I've penned down my thoughts in [articles]({{< ref "/posts/">}}) and shared them out loud at [conferences]({{< relref "appearances">}}). Whether it's a page or a stage, I'm there.

That's all.
