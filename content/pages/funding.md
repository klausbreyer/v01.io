I invest with a small fund in a limited number of startups before (or shortly after) founding.

In return for shares, I provide know-how/money/both.

I can build stuff by myself or take the role of an advisory board member – whatever makes sense in the constellation.

## Portfolio

### 2021 – Now [Fillter][2]: personal inbound assistant for social media creators

Fillter is a form for all social media creator requests. They link Fillter in their link tree, Instagram bio, or website. Through a unique questioning technique, the requests come as usual via email – only in good.

The tool is a joint venture with [Felix and Oğuz][3]. We all work hands-on as equal cofounders, with our individual skills, to bring the project to the world.

### 2019 – Now [touch361][4]: business intelligence software for marketing touchpoint analysis

I am a technical sparring partner for founders with marketing and business intelligence as their focus. The challenges we tackle here focus on data protection / DSGVO and the product development process with the technical service provider.

### 2018 – Now [vitalfunktion GmbH][5]: Pharma tech startup with B2C and B2B apps for medication intolerances

The startup’s main product is a really smooth-to-use app for medication intolerances. I am sparring with the founder Maximilian (pharmacist), weekly for product development and monetization. Currently, we have a solid number of several thousand MAU (Monthly Active Users) and refinance the app through fixed advertising cooperations in the pharmaceutical industry.

In addition, there is also a B2B variant (planned initially as a pivot) aimed at doctors and pharmacists. I developed the prototype in Material UI and still maintain the product today.
