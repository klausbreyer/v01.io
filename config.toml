  description = 'I have been responsible for technology and teams since I founded my first startup in 2010, right after graduating in Software Engineering. Since then, I have been actively or consultatively involved in several other companies as CTO and CPO. I have built, managed, and launched many individual technical projects in (a constantly changing) modern web stack: From fast-moving independent startup projects to brownfield microservice environments. '
